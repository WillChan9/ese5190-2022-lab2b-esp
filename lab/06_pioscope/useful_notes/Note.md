# DMA
For each channel, the DMA maintains a `counter`. Each 1-clock pulse on the `dreq` signal will increment this counter (saturating). When nonzero, the **channel requests a transfer** from the DMAâ€™s internal arbiter, and the counter is **decremented** when the transfer is issued to the address FIFOs. At this point the transfer is in flight, but has not yet necessarily completed.

### chaining 

# PIO
Functionality: there's two PIO and each of them can be used for any GPIOs ([1.4.3](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf))
### data flow
Memory -> TXF(auto `PULL`) -> OSR(`OUT`) -> GPIO <br>
Memory <- RXF(auto `PUSH`) <- ISR(`IN`) <- GPIO
# Architecture 
AHB and AHB-Lite: [Differences](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0243/c/apas01s01), In a simple word: single master, no arbitration

# GPIO 
Reading `GPIO_IN` returns all 30 GPIO values  in a single read. Software can then mask out
individual pins it is interested in.
